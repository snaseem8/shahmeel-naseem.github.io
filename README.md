# About Me

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I am a **Master of Science in Robotics student** with a strong foundation in robotics software development, autonomy, and simulation. I specialize in building reliable and intelligent robotic systems by combining knowledge of control theory, perception, and embedded development. My work spans autonomous navigation, simulation frameworks, machine learning, and hardware-software integration. I am passionate about solving complex real-world problems in robotics through systems-level thinking and rigorous engineering practices.
